Last year’s block party was one of the best ever! Over $1500 was spent on food, water slide rental, a live DJ and more.

This year we’re hoping to do more, with face painting for kids and other ideas that come up at the meetings.

To save on fees Michael Shick (585) will collect money via Venmo and Zelle, and Mrs Verna (602) will take cash or checks. Any unused funds will be used for future parties.
